## Objective

As an employee of an IT services company, I have been assigned to a significant project for a Quebec-based hotel in Canada, catering to a predominantly French-speaking customer base. Although most communication will occur in English, there is an opportunity to incorporate a personal touch by using French in certain interactions. My primary objective is to develop chatbots for the client, and considering the high proportion of French-speaking customers, I aim to create a server with endpoints that facilitate seamless translation between English and French languages. This translation capability will enhance the customer experience and ensure effective communication between the hotel and its clientele.
